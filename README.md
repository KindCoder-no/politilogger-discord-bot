# Politi Logger Discord Bot

**NB! This application is using politiet.no api's, and if they contact me and disallow the usage of their api, this repo will be removed/depricated and the bot will become offline**

This is an easy integration to get updates from politiet.no/politiloggen directly in a discord channel

You can add the bot with this url:
````
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1305653389107003493&permissions=2147494976&integration_type=0&scope=bot
````

This is the first bot i have made since Discord added the slash commands, so the code and functions may not be pretty


## Todo:
- Move from file database to MongoDB
- Add support for direct messages with updates
- Better code structure and error handling

Im open for ideas and contributions, PR's are welcome
