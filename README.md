# Politi Logger Discord Bot

A bot that fetches the latest updates from [politiloggen](https://www.politiet.no/politiloggen/) and posts them directly into a Discord channel.

> **Note**: This application uses the public APIs from politiet.no. If we receive a request to stop using their API, this repository will be deprecated, and the bot will be taken offline.

## Features

- Fetches real-time updates from politiet.no's log.
- Posts updates directly to your designated Discord channel.

## Getting Started

You can add the Politi Logger Discord Bot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1305653389107003493&permissions=2147494976&integration_type=0&scope=bot).

This bot is my first using Discordâ€™s slash command system, so while it functions well, some code structure and features may be refined over time.

## Future Improvements

- **Direct Message Support**: Enable users to receive updates via direct message.
- **Code Structure**: Improve organization and add robust error handling.
- **Message and Embed Structure**: Enhance formatting and delivery of updates for better readability.
